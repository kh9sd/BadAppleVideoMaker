works to create those bad apple memes you see on youtube like

download the shit and run the master.py

once you have the image files (should be in a created folder Frames), use the ffmpeg commands at the bottom of master.py to compile into mp4 (first drag the badapple.mp3 into the folder)

there's some options you can tweak in the code so you can have outlines or color
but im too lazy to make it a convenient interface
